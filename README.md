# Vue Projects
Here are several Vue projects I created. Javascript, HTML/CSS are also used in the projects.

## Local project - Jay's Notebook
Gained CSS style code from [黑马](http://yun.itheima.com/course/609.html?bili), Jay's Notebook includes the following features:
<ol>
  <li>Add a note</li>
  <li>Delete a note</li>
  <li>Clear all notes</li>
  <li>Count current number of notes</li>
</ol>
And it contains basic Vue commands, such as v-show, v-on, v-text, v-bind, v-for and v-model.

More to come...

#### All projects are learned from [黑马](http://yun.itheima.com/course/609.html?bili) in the Summer of 2022.
